# Is Between

Your goal is to write a function called `isBetween`. It does exactly what you think. The function should take three arguments: `num`, `min`, and `max`. The function should return `true` or `false` if num is in between min and max inclusive.

To run the specs follow these commands:

  ```shell
  $ learn  # runs only in the terminal
  $ learn -b # runs also in the browser
  ```
